# üìÇ GECA Trial 001 ‚Äî Final Archive and Adjudicated Resolution (v5.7)

## Summary

This repository contains the full archive and validation record for **GECA Trial 001**, the first empirically adjudicated test of the **Griffin Epistemic Containment Architecture (GECA)**.

GECA is a structural containment system for AI-generated claims, designed to suppress unverifiable content based on benchmark traceability, structural resemblance, and emotional mimicry ‚Äî not source authority.

This trial tested GECA under simulated conditions, found critical failures in v5.6, and validated a successful constitutional reform in v5.7. The system now demonstrates consistent, rule-based suppression behavior under formal protocol.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è What Was Tested

- 50 AI-generated claims were reviewed by three simulated agents:
  - **R-Node** (rule-follower)
  - **H-Node** (humanlike)
  - **A-Node** (authority-biased)

- Suppression was based on three criteria:
  - **Benchmark Traceability Score (BTS+)**
  - **Rhetorical Slot Detection (RSD)**
  - **Emotional Paraphrase Filtering (EPF)**

### Suppression Rule:
```python
if BTS+ ‚â§ 2 or RSD ‚â• 0.75 or EPF ‚â• 0.8:
    suppress



‚∏ª

‚ùå Trial Failure (v5.6)
	‚Ä¢	High false negative rate (~90%)
	‚Ä¢	Inconsistent application of suppression thresholds
	‚Ä¢	Misused failure tags (F1/F2)
	‚Ä¢	Agents drifted from protocol

Outcome:

GECA v5.6 was ruled invalid under Tier Œ©.140 ‚Äî Judicial System Reform

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Reform Outcome (v5.7)

GECA was revised according to adjudication by Claude (Anthropic):
	‚Ä¢	140.B.1 ‚Äî Mechanical Enforcement: no more discretion in suppression
	‚Ä¢	140.B.2 ‚Äî Failure Tag Revision: based on protocol-action contradiction
	‚Ä¢	140.B.3 ‚Äî Decision Tree Simplification: binary logic gate for enforcement

Trial Results (GECA v5.7):

Metric	v5.6	v5.7
False Negatives (F2)	~90%	~5% ‚úÖ
False Positives (F1)	4‚Äì6	1 ‚úÖ
Agent Agreement	Low	High ‚úÖ

Claude reviewed the results and declared GECA v5.7 structurally sound and procedurally validated.
